**Your Project‚Äôs Automated Open Source License Guardian for VS Code**

## üîç Features

### 1. Comprehensive & Intelligent Dependency Tree
Click the üõ°Ô∏è icon in the Activity Bar to get a clear, organized view of all dependencies across your workspace.
*   **Grouped by Manifest**: Dependencies are grouped by their manifest file (e.g., `frontend/package.json`, `backend/pom.xml`), perfect for monorepos.
*   **At-a-Glance Status**: Instantly identify the status of each dependency with intuitive icons:
    *   ‚úÖ **Compliant**: The license is in your `allowedLicenses` list.
    *   ‚ùå **Non-Compliant**: The license is in your `deniedLicenses` list or a policy override.
    *   ‚ùì **Unknown**: The license is not in any policy list and requires manual review. An error during fetching may also result in this state.
*   **Deep Obligation Insights**: Expand a dependency to see its key legal obligations, such as:
    *   $(error) Source code must be disclosed if distributed.
    *   $(warning) Changes to the licensed code must be stated.
    *   $(info) Must include the original copyright notice.

### 2. Real-Time Editor Insights
Get immediate feedback without leaving your code.
*   **Inline Decorations**: License information and compliance status appear directly next to the dependency line in your manifest files.
*   **Detailed Hover Information**: Hover over a dependency to see a popup with its name, version, license, compliance reason, key obligations, and a direct link to its homepage.
*   **On-Save Analysis**: The extension automatically re-scans a manifest file every time you save it.

### 3. Powerful Context Menu Actions
Right-click to access powerful commands directly where you need them.
*   **In the Tree View**:
    *   **Go to File**: Jump directly to the manifest file.
    *   **Open Homepage**: Open the dependency's homepage in your browser.
    *   **Copy Dependency Info**: Copy all details of a dependency as a JSON object.
    *   **Update Policy**: Instantly add a dependency's license to your `allowedLicenses` or `deniedLicenses` in `settings.json`.
*   **In the Editor**:
    *   Right-click within a supported manifest file to **Start Scan**, **Refresh**, or **Clear Cache & Rescan**.

### 4. Flexible & Granular Policy Configuration
Define your organization's license policies in your workspace `.vscode/settings.json`.
*   **Allow & Deny Lists**: Maintain simple arrays of approved or forbidden license identifiers (SPDX).
*   **Exclusion Patterns**: Specify folders to ignore during scanning using glob patterns.
*   **Policy Overrides**: Set specific rules for individual packages, overriding the global policy. This is perfect for handling exceptions approved by your legal team.

    ```json
    // .vscode/settings.json
    {
      "license-sentinel.allowedLicenses": ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause"],
      "license-sentinel.deniedLicenses": ["AGPL-3.0-only", "GPL-3.0-only", "CC-BY-NC-4.0"],
      "license-sentinel.excludePatterns": [
        "**/node_modules/**",
        "**/target/**",
        "**/build/**"
      ],
      "license-sentinel.policyOverrides": [
        {
          "name": "a-gpl-licensed-package",
          "version": "1.2.3",
          "allow": true,
          "reason": "Approved for internal use only by Legal team."
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### 5. Exportable Reports & Interactive Status Bar
*   **Export Reports**: Generate comprehensive reports in **Markdown** for human-readable summaries or **CSV** for data analysis.
*   **Status Bar**: Get a persistent overview of your project's license health with live counts (‚úÖ Compliant | ‚ùì Unknown | ‚ùå Non-Compliant). Click it anytime to refresh the scan.

### 6. Caching for Performance
*   **Smart Caching**: License Sentinel caches dependency information to provide faster analysis on subsequent scans.
*   **Clear Cache**: Use the `License Sentinel üõ°Ô∏è: Clear Cache & Rescan` command to fetch fresh data for all dependencies.

### 7. Broad Language Support
License Sentinel is built to handle modern polyglot projects.
