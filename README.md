**Your Project‚Äôs Automated Open Source License Guardian for VS Code**

LicenseSentinel empowers development teams to manage, audit, and enforce open-source license policies directly within Visual Studio Code, eliminating manual overhead and legal surprises.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Open-source dependencies accelerate development but introduce licensing complexity and risks, such as:

* **License Incompatibility**: Conflicts between permissive and copyleft licenses
* **Unvetted Components**: Bundled dependencies with unknown or custom licenses
* **Compliance Overhead**: Manual auditing across manifests, CI pipelines, and documentation

**LicenseSentinel** seamlessly integrates into your workflow, providing continuous scanning, real-time alerts, and customizable policy enforcement so you can focus on building, not legal checklists.

---

## üîç Features

### 1. Real-Time Scanning and Inline Insights

* **On-Save Analysis**: Automatically scan dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `pom.xml`) every time you save a file.
* **Inline Decorations**: License information appears directly in code editors, with colored badges for compliant, unknown, and non-compliant statuses.
* **Hover Details**: Detailed popups show full license text, version, repository link, and risk level.

### 2. Activity Bar Dashboard

* **Aggregated Overview**: Click the üõ°Ô∏è icon in the Activity Bar to open a dashboard summarizing:

  * Total dependencies scanned
  * Counts by status (‚úÖ Compliant | ‚ùì Unknown | ‚ùå Non-Compliant)
  * Recent changes and newly introduced risks
* **Filtering & Search**: Filter by license type, status, or specific dependency names.

### 3. Configurable Policy Rules

* **Allowlist & Denylist**: Define arrays of approved or forbidden licenses in VS Code `settings.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "license-sentinel.allowedLicenses": ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause"],
    "license-sentinel.deniedLicenses": ["GPL-3.0", "AGPL-3.0"],
    "license-sentinel.cacheDurationHours": 24
  }
  ```
* **Severity Levels**: Assign custom severity (e.g., warning vs. error) per license for editor diagnostics.
* **Custom Overrides**: Per-project or per-folder rule sets for monorepos and multi-module repositories.


### 4. Multi-Language and Multi-Platform Support

| Language              | Manifest File    |     Status    |
