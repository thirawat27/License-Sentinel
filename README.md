**Your Project‚Äôs Automated Open Source License Guardian for VS Code**

It seamlessly integrates into your workflow, providing continuous scanning, real-time insights, and powerful actions to eliminate manual overhead and legal surprises.

## üîç Features

### 1. Comprehensive Dependency Tree
Click the üõ°Ô∏è icon in the Activity Bar to get a clear, organized view of all dependencies across your workspace.
* **Grouped by Manifest**: Dependencies are grouped by their manifest file (e.g., `frontend/package.json`, `backend/pom.xml`), perfect for monorepos.
* **At-a-Glance Status**: Instantly identify the status of each dependency with intuitive icons:
    * ‚úÖ **Compliant**: The license is in your `allowedLicenses` list.
    * ‚ùå **Non-Compliant**: The license is in your `deniedLicenses` list.
    * ‚ùì **Unknown**: The license is not in any policy list and requires manual review. An error during fetching may also result in this state.
* **Built-in Filtering**: Use the filter box to quickly find specific dependencies or files.

### 2. Real-Time Editor Insights
Get immediate feedback without leaving your code.
* **Inline Decorations**: License information and compliance status appear directly next to the dependency line in your manifest files.
* **Detailed Hover Information**: Hover over a dependency to see a popup with its name, version, license, status, and a direct link to its homepage.
* **On-Save Analysis**: The extension automatically re-scans a manifest file every time you save it.

### 3. Interactive Status Bar
The status bar provides a persistent, summarized overview of your project's license health.
* **Live Counts**: See the total number of compliant, unknown, and non-compliant dependencies at a glance.
* **Click to Refresh**: Simply click the status bar item to trigger a full workspace scan at any time.

### 4. Powerful Context Menu Actions
Right-click to access powerful commands directly where you need them.
* **In the Tree View**:
    * **Go to File**: Jump directly to the manifest file.
    * **Open Homepage**: Open the dependency's homepage in your browser.
    * **Copy Dependency Info**: Copy all details of a dependency as a JSON object to your clipboard.
    * **Update Policy**: Instantly add a dependency's license to your `allowedLicenses` or `deniedLicenses` in `settings.json`.
* **In the Editor**:
    * Right-click within a supported manifest file to **Start Scan**, **Refresh**, or **Clear Cache & Rescan**.

### 5. Flexible Policy Configuration
Define your organization's license policies in your workspace `settings.json`.
* **Allow & Deny Lists**: Maintain simple arrays of approved or forbidden license identifiers. The check is case-insensitive and supports multi-license strings (e.g., "MIT OR Apache-2.0").
* **Custom Exclusions**: Specify folders to ignore during scanning using glob patterns.

    ```json
    // .vscode/settings.json
    {
      "license-sentinel.allowedLicenses": ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause"],
      "license-sentinel.deniedLicenses": ["GPL-2.0", "AGPL-3.0", "CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0"],
      "license-sentinel.excludePatterns": [
        "**/node_modules/**",
        "**/target/**",
        "**/build/**",
        "**/testdata/**"
      ]
    }
    ```

### 6. Exportable Reports
Generate comprehensive reports for auditing or documentation.
* **Export to Markdown**: Create a full, human-readable compliance report (`.md`).
* **Export to CSV**: Generate a CSV file of all scanned dependencies and their details, perfect for importing into other tools.

### 7. Caching for Performance
* **Smart Caching**: License Sentinel caches dependency information to provide faster analysis on subsequent scans.
* **Clear Cache**: If you suspect the data is stale or encounter issues, use the `License Sentinel üõ°Ô∏è: Clear Cache & Rescan` command to fetch fresh data for all dependencies.

### 8. Broad Language Support
License Sentinel is built to handle modern polyglot projects.
